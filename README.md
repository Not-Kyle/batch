# "batch" is a collecton of all the languages I've practiced<br />
 I've introduced my knowledge in the few languages including
  * Javascript <br />
  * C <br />
  * Java <br />
  * Lua/Luau <br />
  * Markdown <br />
  
 So here is a collection of all things random from those langauges! <br />

  I have learned a few languages and have not used many of them here are my reasons <br />

   * Javascript <br />
     > [!I recently dropped learning Javascript a year ago after getting mixed up with Java]\ <br /> 
     > I wanted to create Minecraft hacks and found out Javascript has nothing to do with Java <br />
   * C <br />
     > I dropped C two years ago realizing I had no use for C as I don't code anything using C <br />
     > I don't have a use for C <br />
   * Java <br />
     > I am still learning Java as of today April 15 2024, as I would love to go into Minecraft Clients <br />
   * Lua / Luau <br />
     > I am still learning new things of Luau everyday, as of recently I still need to learn most of Synapse X functions <br />
     > Synapse X functions like Bit, Crypt, and Debug <br />
     > I have not mastered Luau yet, but I'm good at it <br />
   * Markdown <br />
     > I only use this for github, but it's got to be one of the easiest languages to master <br />
